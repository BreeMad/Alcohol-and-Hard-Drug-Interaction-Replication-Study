## Objective
The goal of this project is to verify the findings of the chosen empirical study by independently reproducing its results using the same methods and data analysis techniques.

## Research Question
Are those who heavily drink alcohol more likely to use hard drugs when they turn 21?

## Importance
Alcohol is popular among young people so its important for policymakers to understand how drinking alcohol might influence other risky behaviors such as using hard drugs.

## Conclusion
+ Number of people who use hard drugs decreased discontinuously at age 21 by approx. 2 percentage points.
  + Robust across different specifications
  
+ Drastic increase in alcohol consumption at age 21

+ Alcohol consumption isnâ€™t a gateway to hard drug use
  + Alcohol and hard drugs are substitutes NOT complements

+ Robust to inclusion of covariates, birthday effects, & different specifications and polynomial degrees.
